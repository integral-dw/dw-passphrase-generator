;; Diceware (C) 1995-2020 Arnold G. Reinhold

;; IMPORTANT: Please read the below section to know how to use this
;; package, as it requires additional files *NOT* included in the base
;; install.  Apart from the listed requirements, this package requires (ideally)
;; one or more casino-grade dice for true random number generation.


;; Basic setup:
;;
;; This package requires a so called wordlist to function as intended.
;; This file serves as the pool of random words from which your secure
;; passphrase is generated.  Put a wordlist for passphrase generation
;; into the directory specified by ‘dw-directory’.  It will be
;; automatically generated the first time this package is loaded.  If
;; you don't already have a wordlist, you can find two common, English
;; wordlists below:

;; https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt
;; http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc

;; The above wordlist from the EFF is also provided as a
;; pre-internalized form in ‘dw-eff-large’.  If you prefer to try out
;; the package *without* having to download a separate file, just add
;; the following to your init:

;; (with-eval-after-load 'dw
;;   (setq-default dw-current-wordlist dw-eff-large))

;; The former generates passphrases with long, common words while the
;; latter favors short words and letter combinations, which may be
;; harder to remember but quicker to type.  You can find wordlists
;; for many other languages here:

;; http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html#Diceware%20in%20Other%20Languages|outline

;; Basic usage:
;;
;; 1) Choose a buffer to write your passphrase in (temporarily).
;; 2) Roll your dice, reading them in some consistent way (e.g. left to
;;    right) every time, and typing them neatly separated in groups of
;;    five.  You can separate them using any character matched by
;;    ‘dw-separator-regexp’ (whitespace by default).  For example, if you
;;    rolled ⚄⚂⚀⚅⚅, type "53166".  You will need five times as many die
;;    rolls as you want words in your passphrase (six being a decent
;;    amount for normal passphrases).
;; 3) Mark the region where you wrote down your sequence of rolls and
;;    use the command ‘dw-passgen-region’.  You may need to choose a
;;    wordlist depending on your setup.  See the documentation for
;;    ‘dw-named-wordlists’ below for how to skip this step and set up
;;    a default wordlist.

;; This package provides the following interactive commands:
;;
;; * dw-passgen-region
;;
;;    The all-in-one interactive passphrase generation command, and
;;    most likely everything you'll ever need from this package.  Just
;;    mark the region containing your written down die rolls and run
;;    the command.

;; * dw-set-wordlist
;;
;;     Manually set a wordlist without invoking ‘dw-passgen-region’,
;;     and regardless of whether a wordlist has been set for the
;;     current buffer before.

;; Final notes:
;; The package itself is not at all required to create diceware
;; passphrases, but automates the table lookup bit of it.

  "Unique, personal string to append to passphrases.
Salt is a string of non-secret data to append to your
passphrases.  It serves to prevent dictionary attacks, and makes
it harder for potential attackers to brute force multiple keys at
once.

While it is not a good idea to use the same passphrase for
everything, it is best to use the same salt or everything, as it
frees precious mental real estate.  You can use a phone number, a
random string of characters, or anything else for this purpose,
as long as it is sufficiently unique.

It is also a great way to fulfill those pesky demands of some
services to have a special character, a number and an uppercase
character in it without adding mental overhead.

If non-nil, interactive commands should ask whether they should
append the salt, depending on the value of ‘dw-use-salt’.

LAX, if non-nil, does not enforce the length of STRING to be a
power of 6.  As a consequence, some rolls will fail to produce a
result.

Remark: The number of die rolls needed to generate a single
character increases logarithmically with the number of
characters: Less than 7 characters require 1 die per roll, less
